{"name":"GNC","tagline":"A software for analyzing gene networks coherence using graph theory","body":"# GNC: Gene Network Coherence\r\n\r\n================================\r\n\r\nThis is a Java software for analyzing gene networks coherence using graph theory.  \r\nThe executable file is on [GNC Repository](https://github.com/JoseAntonioLagares/GNC).\r\n\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nThis application can be used in linux, mac, and windows. On the other hand, GNC software is parallelized using threads. If your computer allows multi-threading operation, result will be showed in a shorter period of time.\r\n\r\nTo use this tool, you must first download the GNC.exe file. This file is a self-extracting package and it contains all necesary items.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, inside the repository there is one random yeast gene network for testing the tool. It is called \"Example Input Network.txt\"\r\n\r\n## Usage information\r\n==================================\r\nTo launch the app you must do a double click in “GNC.jar”. Automatically, a main windows will be appear. \r\nIn this windows, a input network and well known databases can be chosen to star the process. As results will be obtained by the app, they will be showed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any question, please read \"User Guide\" for more details.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting and F.A.Q.\r\n==================================\r\n* Be patient. Although this program is fully optimized, usually it takes a long time.\r\n* Input network files must be a “.txt” file and it must have the following aspect.\r\n      Node1,Node2\r\n      Node1,Node3\r\n      …\r\n      Node1,Node N\r\n      …\r\n      Node N, Node M\r\n* An input network without data will be represented with coherence value of 1. Furthermore, this fact will be appearing if the file does not perform the previous structure.\r\n* GNC works using 2 necessary folders, “BBDD and Matrices”. If both folders are not included with the jar file, an error message will be appear. Under no circumstances shall be modified.\r\n\r\nAUTHOR:\r\nFrancisco Gómez Vela <fgomez@upo.es>, José Antonio Lagares <jalagrod@gmail.es>, Norberto Díaz Díaz <ndiaz@upo.es>.\r\nCopyright © 2013 Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Spain.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
