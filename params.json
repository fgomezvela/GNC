{"name":"GNiC","tagline":"Gene Network inCoherence considering direct and indirect relationships","body":"﻿GNiC: Gene Network inCoherence\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nThis is a Java software for analyzing gene networks incoherence conisdering direct and indirect relationships.\r\nThe executable file is on GNiC Repository.\r\n\r\nThis application can be used in linux, mac, and windows. On the other hand, GNiC software is parallelized using threads. If your computer allows multi-threading operation, result will be showed in a shorter period of time.\r\n\r\nTo use this tool, you must download the GNiC.zip file. Furthermore, inside this zip file,there is one folder called \"GNiC\". This folder contains several crucial information to the jar file. Also, it contains many yeast gene network for testing the tool grouped as \"Input Network\" and \"Biological Databases\". \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage information\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTo launch the app, extract the zip file and do a double click in “GNiC.jar”. Automatically, a main windows will be appear. In this windows, a input network and well known databases can be chosen to star the process. As results will be obtained by the app, they will be showed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any question, please read \"User Guide\" for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting and F.A.Q.\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n*Be patient. Although this program is fully optimized, usually it takes a long time.\r\n*Make sure that you dispose the lastest Java update installed.\r\n*Give to Java Virtual Machine enough memory. At least 2048 MB. The more memory, the better.\r\n*News input network and biological databases files must be a “.txt” file and it must have the following aspect:\r\n\r\nNode1,Node2\r\n\r\nNode1,Node3\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNode1,Node N\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNode N, Node M\r\n*Do not modify or handle the \"GNiC\" folder under any situation.\r\n*For more datails use \"User Guide\".\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n=========\r\n<a href=\"http://www.upo.es/eps/fgomez/\">Francisco Gómez Vela</a> (<a href=\"mailto:fgomez@upo.es\">fgomez@upo.es</a>), José Antonio Lagares (<a href=\"mailto:jalagrod@gmail.com\">jalagrod@gmail.com</a>), <a href=\"http://www.upo.es/eps/ndiaz/\">Norberto Díaz-Díaz</a> (<a href=\"mailto:ndiaz@upo.es\">ndiaz@upo.es</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.upo.es/eps/aguilar/\">Jesús S.
