GNC: Gene Network Coherence
===========================

This is a Java software for analyzing gene networks coherence using graph theory.
The executable file is on GNC Repository.

This application can be used in linux, mac, and windows. On the other hand, GNC software is parallelized using threads. If your computer allows multi-threading operation, result will be showed in a shorter period of time.

To use this tool, you must download the GNC.jar file. 

Furthermore, inside the repository there is one folder called "Sample Data". This folder contains several yeast gene network for testing the tool grouped as "Input Network" and "Biological Databases". Inside these folders,


Usage information
=================

To launch the app you must do a double click in “GNC.jar”. Automatically, a main windows will be appear. In this windows, a input network and well known databases can be chosen to star the process. As results will be obtained by the app, they will be showed.

If you have any question, please read "User Guide" for more details.


Troubleshooting and F.A.Q.
==========================

*Be patient. Although this program is fully optimized, usually it takes a long time.
*Input network files must be a “.txt” file and it must have the following aspect:

Node1,Node2

Node1,Node3

...

Node1,Node N

...

Node N, Node M
