GNC: Using Graph Theory To Analyze Gene Network Coherence
===========================================

This is a Java-based software tool for analyzing gene networks coherence using direct and indirect relationships.
This tool can be used in linux, mac, and windows. In addition, GNC software is parallelized using a multi-threading design. 

To use the application, please, download the GNC.zip file. Inside this zip file, there is a folder called "GNC". This folder contains several crucial information of the executable file. Also, it contains some gene networks for testing the tool grouped as "Input Network" and "Biological Databases". 


Usage information
=================

To launch the app, extract the zip file. There are two different implementations; a java swing GUI interface and a command line. If you have any question, please read "User Guide" for more details.


Troubleshooting and F.A.Q.
==========================

  *Be patient. Although this program is fully optimized, usually it takes a long time, specially if you use files bigger than 1 MB.
  *Make sure that you have the JVM 1.5 or higher.
  *Give to Java Virtual Machine enough memory. At least 2048 MB. The more memory, the better.
  *News input network and biological databases files must be a “.txt” file and it must have the following aspect:

Node1,Node2

Node1,Node3

...

Node1,Node N

...

Node N, Node M

  *Please, do not modify or handle the "GNC" folder.
  *For further information see the "User Guide.pdf" file provided.
